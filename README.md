# Fit Women's Weekly Marketing Site

The Fit Women's Weekly marketing site is currently built in Gatsby. It is about to be redesigned and most likely moved to NextJS.

It's primary goal is to collect leads for the different services and products Fit Women's Weekly offers.

This site uses Sanity.io for it's blogging CMS.

Sanity has been great to use. It makes it very easy for the content creators to upload content since the backend only exposes the fields they need and nothing else.

### Technologies Used

- Gatsby
- Greensock
- Sanity.io
- GraphQL
- Netlify
