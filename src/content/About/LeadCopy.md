- Fitness "influencers" with **zero training** experience, who sell really crappy - PDF - ebooks and t-shirts.
- "BIG GYM" style websites created by investors and business people... people who do it for the **return on investment**, not the passion.
- Itâ€™s the hardcore fitness culture who makes you think severe, **unsustainable** diets and workouts are the only - correct - way.
