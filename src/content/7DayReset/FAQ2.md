question: Do I need special equipment to get started?
---

**Yes and no**. For the Ignite Reset, you will need a band like this. But I'll show you where to get one or what you can use instead.

For the **Body Burn Reset you don’t need any equipment**. But if you want, you can use dumbbells for the squats, lunges, and some other exercises. I’ll show you in the app.

For the **Strong Reset, you do need one kettlebell**. I recommend Rogue kettlebells. And a good weight to start with is 26lbs.
