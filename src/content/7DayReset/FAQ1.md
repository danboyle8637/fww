question: Is this really free or will I be auto-billed in the future?
---

Yes, it's free! And youâ€™ll have access to these workouts forever.

When our full app releases, the app will not be free but you will have sign up for that separately if you want to get access to all of the programs and coaching. Our deadline is December 1st of 2019 to have the first version released.
