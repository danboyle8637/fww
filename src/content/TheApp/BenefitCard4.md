After you finish a workout, check it off your workout list and record how you did on the workout goal.

The workout goal is **one specific thing to track** for future reference. It might be how long it took you to do a circuit... or how many squats you did... or what weight you used... how long you held a hollow hold...

Every workout has **one specific goal to track**.
