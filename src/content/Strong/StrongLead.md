Metabolic strength training with kettlebells.

**This is high intensity (very fast paced) style of workout**.

Your heart rate will spike and you’ll be breathing hard... at the same time you’ll have to use insane strength and focus as you fling a kettlebell around your body in a variety of tough exercises.

**There is NOTHING like full blast kettlebell workouts**.

And you’ll get the perfect start with Strong... my Level 1 kettlebell program.
