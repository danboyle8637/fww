This is an in-depth breakdown of every fundamental kettlebell exercise like the:

- Kettlebell deadlift
- Swing and its variations
- Clean and rack position
- Press and double press
- Squat and its variations
- High pull and snatch
- Even the Turkish Getup.

I’ll coach you how to do each exercise.

I’ve designed drills for you to practice.

I’ve even designed practice workouts so you can make these second nature.
