I created the 7 Day Strong Reset mini-program.

I’ve designed five workouts and you don’t need any technical kettlebell skills to do these.

Each one builds upon the last to help you:

- Get introduced to using a kettlebell.
- To perfect goblet squat technique.
- How to swing the kettlebell correctly.
- A clean technique to get started fast.
- And a final challenge that will wake you up.

The 7 Day Strong Reset is yours for **FREE**.

Inside you'll be able to track your progress and get a feel for what the final full app will be like.
