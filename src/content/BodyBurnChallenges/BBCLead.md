Metabolic strength training. A high intensity (fast paced) style of workout combining cardio with fast paced strength training.

Your heart rate will cycle from nearly rested to maximal levels, but not through running.

**You’ll do fast paced strength exercises like:**

- Uneven squats
- Pushup pulses
- Deadman burpees
- Gorilla shuffles
- Curtsey lunges
- And so much more!

You’ll sweat more than you’ve ever sweated… your muscles will burn more than they’ve ever burned… you’ll improve coordination… and shape a fit, defined, athletic body.
